The document class is initialized by issuing the \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[]\{ntnuthesis\}} at the beginning of your \texttt{.tex} file. The thesis language should be given as an option. Currently British English (class option \texttt{[british]}), American English (class option \texttt{[american]}), Norwegian Bokm√•l (class option \texttt{[norsk]}) and Norwegian Nynorsk (class option \texttt{[nynorsk]}) are supported.\footnote{Disclaimer: this unfortunate naming of the Norwegian language options follows from the naming conventions of the \texttt{babel} package.}

There is also the \texttt{titlepage} class option that triggers the generation of a simple title page that can be used as a placeholder when writing the thesis. This option should be removed before handing in the thesis. Instead the official NTNU titlepage for the corresponding thesis type should be added as described on Innsida.\footnote{see \url{https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Finalizing+the+bachelor+and+master+thesis} for bachelor and master, and \url{https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Printing+your+thesis} for PhD.}
